## Project Description:

The Iris Flower Classification project focuses on developing a machine-learning model to classify iris flowers into their respective species based on specific measurements. Iris flowers are classified into three species: setosa, versicolor, and Virginia, each of which exhibits distinct characteristics in terms of measurements.

Objective:

The primary goal of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a classification model that can accurately identify the species of iris flowers based on their measurements. The model aims to automate the classification process, offering a practical solution for identifying iris species.

Key Project Details:

Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.
The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.
